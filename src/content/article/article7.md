excerpt: "If you have been working as a front-end developer on a team project, you have most likely encountered a scenario where the client-side app was ready, but the server-side or APIs were still underway. Another possible situation is one where even while building the client side, there exists some server-dependent function you would like to test out, but the server side is still not ready. In any scenario where you need a server quickly, a “magical” tool can help you spin up a mock server locally in seconds. This article will look at JSON Server and how it makes the work of a front-end developer a little easier and much faster."
